## Project Goal

> The goal of this project is to make tour guide apps more available to tourists and museums (or anyone else) while sacrificing the least amount of customizability. - Tour Anywhere

## Project Structure

> The project contains two essential parts - the website application and the mobile application. Currently only Android is supported for mobile usage. The website is constructed with the NodeJS framework and utilizes the EJS templating system. For storage, a MongoDB database is hosted on mLab. The entire website is built using the C9.io online IDE and cloud hosting service.
